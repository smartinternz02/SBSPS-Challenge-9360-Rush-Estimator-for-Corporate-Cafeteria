# SBSPS-Challenge-9360-Rush-Estimator-for-Corporate-Cafeteria
Rush Estimator for Corporate Cafeteria

we will be using Tensorflow for traning our machinie learning model and to use pre-made pipeline which is already present in tensorflow.
Pandas and numpy to analyse the data and matplotlib to visualize.

then we will be using a file "labels.csv" which contains our training dataset.

then we have created function for collecting data from the images such as object detection, person counting,
drawing boxes around the target.

then we will analyse the data and plot a graph for mean value from our dataset.
And start detecting object in images and tuning the detection to detect humans only.
after that plot a graph to determine the absolute errors.

Now we will predict and compare our test data.
and save it.
